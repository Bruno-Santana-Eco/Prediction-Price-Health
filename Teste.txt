Introduction As you may know now, ChatGPT is a language generation model developed by OpenAI. you can ask it anything you want. 
So why not learn algorithmic trading with ChatGPT? At the beginning, I wanted to just play with it and see what answers I would get. 
I didnt believe in it, but I can admit I was really impressed. So let me show you how you could use it to learn different types of algorithmic 
trading (By practicing using Python code examples). But before that, here are some warnings: There is no recommendation of the best algorithm
 to use DO NOT USE IT to make investment decisions in financial markets. This is in no way an encouragement to invest in financial markets. 
 Take into account the warning raised by ChatGPT on many code python examples it gives.
